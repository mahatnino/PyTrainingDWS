STEP 1: Finding Data

Collection of data 
Where do you get data?
All data are quantified 
Data : Individual , descrete , continous | Big data | Textual data | Image Data etc
Data type/Format : CSV, XML, SQL , TXT 

STEP 2: Data Cleaning (Very very Important and time consuming ) 

Reasons:
Neglegance by human in entry of data
Data are from various source 
Data are unstructed at inital phase
Data are unbaised 
0,1 type of data like male-femle, true-false
Distribution of data (unfavourable) {outliers}
Null data ( Solution - approximate. Regression ) 

STEP 3 : Data Mapping 

STEP 4:  Data Filtering

Hypothesis testing
Correlation {correlation is not necessarily the causation in all case}

STEP 5: Use

Problems (classification -predict where does the value lie , regression- predict what the value)

#BINOMIAL DISTRIBUTION 
#STANDARD DEVIATION
Home work: 
1. what happens if you put mean , mode or median value in Null data
= Using the measures of central tendency involves substituting the missing values with the mean or median for numerical variables and the mode for categorical variables. The major limitation of using this method is that it leads to biased estimates of the variances and covariance. The standard errors and test statistics can also be underestimated and overestimated respectively. This imputation technique works well with when the values are missing completely at random.

2. what is that correlation that mimics like they are correlated
